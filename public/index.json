[{"content":"Assignment description Hahn et al. (2003) report 3 experiments, the findings of which they take as support for what they call the theory of Representational Distortion (RD). Hahn et al. describe RD as a general computational-level theory of similarity, with the purported ability to account for human similarity judgments in a wide variety of contexts and for wide variety of stimulus classes.\nAlthough RD is claimed to have some (intuitive) connections with the formal and uncomputable (!) measure of Kolmogorov complexity, RD theory remains to this day an informal verbal theory of similarity.\nIn this exercise you develop and propose your formalization of RD. More specifically, your task is to formally define (as best as possible) an input-output function characterizing the computation of the similarity of pairs of objects. The particular input-output function that you propose is to capture (in one way or another) the informal idea underlying RD as described by Hahn et al. In your proposed formalization, try to be as precise as possible, but without doing injustice to the intended generality of RD.\nFor example, it is clear that Hahn et al. intend the theory to apply in principle for all kinds of structured representations relevant for cognition and for many (or even all) possible cognitive domains where similarity judgements can be made (e.g., visual objects, linguistic entities, movements, etc.). This means that your formalization will likely need to include some free parameters and/or make some high-level abstractions.\nTo contextualize your formalization, provide your interpretation of the verbal theory by Hahn et al. in Section 1. Explain and motivate how your interpretation captures the original (verbal) theory as the authors intend it, by using quotes from the article of Hahn et al. Provide your formalization in Section 2. Make sure that your formalization properly and soundly formalizes your (interpretation) of the verbal theory. You might discover ambiguity or inconsistencies in the verbal theory. Hence, you will need to explain and motivate why you opted for particular choices in your formalization. In Section 3 you can explain the motivation of your choices and any other reflections that you want to share with the reader.\nSome tips and challenges Adopt an iterative approach. That is, do not try to formalize RD in one go (this will be too hard, and you may actually lose the intended meaning of RD). Instead start by formulating a precise yet informal (verbal) input-output function. Only if you are happy with this informal definition should you start trying to formalize the notions used in the input and output description. During formalization you may run into problems that force you to make changes to the initial informal definition. Make the required changes and try again. You may even find it more convenient to gradually move from informal to pre-formal to semi-formal to formal. Just see what works.\nThe informal description of RD by Hahn et al. may not be internally consistent in all aspects and it may in some places be underspecified (this is one of the common problems with verbal theories, something that often only becomes clear once one tries to formalize the theory). If you encounter such an inconsistency or incompleteness, then document it and make a choice on how you wish to deal with it in your formalization. Be sure to motivate your choice.\nIf you get stuck during the formalization process, carefully document the problems you encountered and how you tried (but perhaps failed) to deal with them.\nIf a \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; component is the best you can do to accommodate the theory\u0026rsquo;s incompleteness, then explicate this in your (semi-)formalization.\nTry to work with Hahn et al., and not against them. By this we mean that—as long as you see some way to do it—you should try to be helpful in filling in any gaps the authors may have left unintentionally. The main goal is to propose as best as possible a formalization of the intuitive ideas underlying RD.\nWhere relevant and possible, use quotes from the paper to motivate choices you make in the formalization.\nHanding-in instructions Please use the following link to find the LaTeX template for this assignment.
